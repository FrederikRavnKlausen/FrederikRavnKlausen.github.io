 I am a Postdoc in Mathematical Physics in [QMATH](https://qmath.ku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen. 

I have broad interests in Mathematical Physics and Quantum Infomation with special emphasis on Anderson Localization, Open Quantum Systems, Classical Statistical Mechanics. In particular, I am interested in signs of Anderson localization in open quantum systems. 
I also like to ponder about models in classical statistical mechanics without monotonicity e.g. the random current representation of the Ising model and the loop-O(1)-model. 

 I have two bachelor degrees in Mathematics and Physics and a master's degree in Mathematics and a PhD in Mathematical Physics (thesis above). 
 During my studies, I have spent semesters in LMU Munich, ETH Zürich, TU Munich.
